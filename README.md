# Realtor.ca Enhanced WebExtension

This is a web extension that adds certain features I wish realtor.ca supported like:

- Allows saving mortgage details like: Downpayment %, Mortgage Rate %, Ammortization Period, and shows monthly estimated costs next to Property list price.
- Cost analysis for a property listing showing Upfront and Monthly cost breakdown.

## Configuration

After installing the web extension you can open up the extension and adjust the following configuration options which are used to calculate monthly cost for each property listing.

- Downpayment % (default 20%): Determines how much downpayment you wish to pay based off the listing price of the property. This will be added to Upfront costs.

- Mortgage Rate % (default 5%): Determines how much compounding interest you will pay over the amortization period of your mortgage. At the time of writing (Q2 2024) most banks are offering around 5-6% rates.

- Amortization Period (default 25 years): The number of years the mortgage will be paid off. Most loans feature a 25 year amortization period but some vendors may offer a maximum of 30 years.of course there is also the option of paying off the loan quicker and picking a shorter period.

## Cost Analysis

### Upfront costs

Upfront costs are costs which may be paid upon purchasing your new home, these include:

- Downpayment amount
- Land transfer tax
- Lawyer fees
- Title fees

### Monthly fees

Ongoing monthly fees are calculated to give a better sense on how much a home will cost factoring in everything you will need to pay. It is important to factor in each of these details to determine if you can afford a home.

Additional expenses you may need to consider when determining a homes affordability are:
